## 2026-05-29 — DR-0001 — Technical Plan Becomes Execution Charter

Decision:

```text
The project moves from internal-paper-first planning to technical-plan-first execution.
The paper is treated as a future outcome summary, not the current execution driver.
```

Context:

- The project north-star remains Tenhou stable dan > LuckyJ 10.68.
- The current stage is P3 / baseline reproducibility audit.
- Mortal F1 is blocked by missing public trained model artifact and local environment prerequisites.
- The project needs one technical execution charter that coordinates web-side research decisions and local Codex implementation.

Rationale:

- A paper-first workflow can encourage premature narrative, overclaiming and stage skipping.
- A technical-plan-first workflow keeps the project grounded in reproducible baselines, unified evaluation, Tenhou-oriented metrics and documented decisions.
- Git + docs are the only durable way to make web-side research decisions actionable for local Codex execution.

Consequences:

- `docs/12_technical_plan/12A_TECHNICAL_PLAN_v0.1.md` becomes the current technical execution charter.
- Web ChatGPT Pro is responsible for solution design, research, review and decision support.
- Local Codex App is responsible for code, tests and documentation landing.
- LuckyJ remains the target benchmark, not a direct full-reproduction object.
- Codex must continue to execute only the first unfinished task in `docs/10_next/10_NEXT.md`.
- Every real task must update changelog, evidence, risk, handoff and next.

Linked docs:

- `docs/12_technical_plan/12A_TECHNICAL_PLAN_v0.1.md`
- `docs/00_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/10_next/10_NEXT.md`
- `docs/09_governance/09_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/09_governance/09_EVIDENCE_LOG.md`
- `docs/09_governance/09_RISK_REGISTER.md`

Status:

```text
Accepted
```
